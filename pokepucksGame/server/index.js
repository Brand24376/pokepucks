/*
// A list for all the required node modules to install or just use npm i by itself to install all of them since they are all listed in the package.json file
// Make sure terminal is in the server folder
// Only way I know to update a node module right now is to run the command to install it again and that updates it to the latest version. If you find a better way to update the node modules, replace this line with the command to do so and make sure to state that it's for updating the node modules.
npm i socket.io
npm i express
npm i jsonwebtoken
npm i express-session
npm i ejs
npm i os
npm i -D nodemon (Not required but makes editing this file much more convenient. Nodemon will restart the server automatically every time you save the server.)
// Start the server by using 'npm start' while in the server folder
// Start the server for testing by using 'npm run dev' while in the server folder
// Remember to change the ip address for your formbar instance in the AUTH_URL variable

// Helpful hotkeys if using VSCode:
ALT + SHIFT + F to format the code
CTRL + / to comment out a line or block of code (you can also uncomment by selecting the code and pressing the same hotkey)
ALT + Z to wrap text (makes it so you don't have to scroll horizontally to read the code)
ALT + UP/DOWN to move a line of code up or down
ALT + SHIFT + UP/DOWN to copy a line of code up or down
ALT + CLICK to select multiple lines of code to edit them all at once

                 * The Game has three stages. Setup, Loop, and End.
                 * Setup is where the players are decided, special rules are decided, health stacks are built, the arena is built, and the slammers are picked,between code lines 371 and 442.
                 * Loop is where the game is played. 
                 * Loop has 6 phases. Top off, Knockout, Count Attacks, Make Attacks, Discard Pucks, and Check for Winner.
                 * Top off is where the arena is filled with pucks from the player's health stacks, in code lines 444 to 490
                 * Knockout is where the player's slammers are placed in the center if they have no pucks in their health stacks, in code lines 492 to 507.
                 * Count Attacks is where the players get the minimum of 1 attack in code lines 509 to 518.
                 * Make Attacks is where the players make their attacks and flip pucks in the arena, in code lines 520 to 617.
                 * Discard Pucks is where the players can use pucks and remove them from the arena and place them in the discard pile, in code lines 619 to 631.
                 * Check for Winner is where the game checks if a player has won, in code lines 633 to 654.
                 * End is where the game ends and the winner is displayed.in code lines 656 to 673.

                 * -Have special abilities for slammers.
                 * -Have special abilities for pucks.
                 * -Show the custom pogs in canvas.
                 * -Have more than two players play the game
