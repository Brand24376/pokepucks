# **Welcome to Pok√©Pucks**

## **What is PokePucks?**
PokePucks is a game of collecting, trading, and staking Pokemon themed 'pucks'. While it can be enjoyed as small individual games called "Battles", it can also be played as an "Adventure". In an Adventure, players track their progress using competing for goals such as collecting all available Pokemon Slammers or Gym Badges. While there are many nuances to the game, the core of the experience is to stack up some pucks and throw a slammer at them, collecting the pucks that land face up.

## **More Info**
